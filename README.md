# Darwins-Wardrobe
A personalisable outfit randomiser for Android and iOS

Hopefully it will be a single c++ application with two wrappers, one for ios and one for android

I may also use GLFM, a library similar to GLFW and made for creating a unified openglES canvas on both android and iOS

android libraries:  NDK, SDK & openGLES
iOS libraries:      openGLES & idk yet

Ima work on getting android to work first (still need to learn loads)
