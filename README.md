# Darwins-Wardrobe
A personalisable outfit randomiser for Android and iOS

I may use GLFM, a library similar to GLFW and made for creating a unified openglES canvas on both android and iOS

libGDX is DEFINITELY on the table, it is a library for java which allows you to create games with openGL ES for both android and iOS

A wrapper for both android and iOS around a main c++ application is still a possibility here... sadly...
