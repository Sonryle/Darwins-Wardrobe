# Outfisual
A personalisable outfit randomiser for Android and iOS

I may use GLFM, a library similar to GLFW and made for creating a unified openglES canvas on both android and iOS

libGDX is DEFINITELY on the table, it is a library for java which allows you to create games with openGL ES for both android and iOS

A wrapper for both android and iOS around a main c++ application is still a possibility here... sadly...

Maybe i can have a GenerateXCodeProjectFiles.bat and a GenerateAndroidStudioProjectFiles.bat idrkkk

I found [a guide to creating OpenGL ES apps on Android and iOS](https://www.google.ie/books/edition/Game_and_Graphics_Programming_for_iOS_an/WOEhPTXSKogC?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover) and I will be trying to follow it in the future
